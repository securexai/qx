# QX Project Plan and Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Overview

**QX** is a modern certification exam preparation application built with a microservices-like architecture within a monorepo. The project provides comprehensive tools for users to prepare for various certification exams through interactive practice questions, progress tracking, and personalized learning paths.

## 🚀 Project Vision

To create a best-in-class exam preparation platform that is:
- **Modern:** Built with a cutting-edge technology stack
- **Scalable:** Designed to support a large user base
- **User-Friendly:** Focused on providing an intuitive and effective learning experience

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Interactive Practice Questions:** A large database of questions with detailed explanations
- **Progress Tracking:** Personalized dashboards to monitor performance and identify areas for improvement
- **Personalized Learning Paths:** Customized study plans based on user performance and goals
- **Exam Simulation:** Realistic exam simulations to prepare users for the real thing

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

The project is divided into the following phases:

- **Phase 0: Environment Setup** - Setting up the development environment and project foundation
- **Phase 1: Project Foundation** - Building the core project structure and backend/frontend setup
- **Phase 2: Core Development** - Implementing the main features of the application
- **Phase 3: Deployment** - Deploying the application to a production environment
- **Phase 4: Advanced Features** - Adding advanced features and enhancements

## 🚧 Phase 0: Environment Setup - COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (October 2025)

### 🎯 Goals Achieved

- ✅ Analyze prerequisites and document requirements
- ✅ Create a prerequisite verification script
- ✅ Establish a foundation for atomic and intent-focused documentation
- ✅ Set up a robust local Kubernetes development environment using Podman and Kind

### 📝 Tasks Completed

- ✅ **Task 0.1: Prerequisites Analysis** - Documented all required tools and versions
- ✅ **Task 0.2: Prerequisite Verification Script** - Enhanced `scripts/install-prereqs.sh` with comprehensive checking for Podman, Kind, kubectl, Bun
- ✅ **Task 0.3: Project Documentation Foundation** - Created structured documentation hierarchy

### 📦 Phase 0.1: Local Kubernetes Environment Setup - IN PROGRESS

**Status:** 🔄 In Progress (Active development)

#### 🎯 Goals
- ✅ Automate the setup of a 3-node Kubernetes cluster using Kind
- ✅ Ensure all core prerequisites (Podman, kubectl, Kind, Bun) are verified and installed
- ✅ Provide a clear, script-driven workflow for starting and stopping the local environment

#### 📝 Tasks Completed
- ✅ **Task 0.1.1: Refine Prerequisite Verification Script** - Completed in Phase 0
- ✅ **Task 0.1.2: Create Kind Cluster Configuration** - `kind-config.yaml` created for 3-node cluster
- ✅ **Task 0.1.3: Develop Cluster Management Scripts** - `start-kind-cluster.sh` and `stop-kind-cluster.sh` created
- [ ] **Task 0.1.4: Document Local Dev Workflow for K8s** - Update documentation with cluster management instructions
- [ ] **Task 0.1.5: Test Cluster Management Scripts** - Validate scripts work correctly

#### 📦 Deliverables Completed
- ✅ Enhanced `install-prereqs.sh` script (completed in Phase 0)
- ✅ `kind-config.yaml` for a 3-node cluster (1 control plane + 2 workers)
- ✅ `start-kind-cluster.sh` script (318 lines, comprehensive cluster management)
- ✅ `stop-kind-cluster.sh` script (250 lines, graceful cleanup)
- [ ] Updated documentation for local Kubernetes environment setup
