# QX Scripts Improvement Tasks

This document outlines the tasks for improving the QX project's installation and management scripts. Each task will be developed using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## Task 1: Enhance Error Handling and Automatic Rollback

*   **Status:** In Progress
*   **TDD Approach:**
    1.  **Write a failing test:** Create a new integration test case that simulates an installation failure. This test should verify that the `perform_rollback` function is called when an error occurs.
    2.  **Implement the feature:** Implement the `ERR` trap and `handle_error` function in `install-prereqs.sh` to make the test pass.
    3.  **Refactor:** Review the implementation for clarity and efficiency.

## Task 2: Improve Configuration Validation

*   **Status:** Not Started
*   **TDD Approach:**
    1.  **Write a failing test:** Create a new unit test case in `test_config.sh` that adds an invalid tool configuration to the `CONFIG_CACHE` and asserts that `validate_config` returns a non-zero exit code.
    2.  **Implement the feature:** Enhance the `validate_config` function in `config.sh` to validate tool-specific configurations.
    3.  **Refactor:** Refactor the validation logic to be more modular and extensible.

## Task 3: Refine Plugin Management

*   **Status:** Not Started
*   **TDD Approach:**
    1.  **Write a failing test:** Create a new unit test case that attempts to load a non-existent plugin and asserts that the `load_plugins` function handles it gracefully.
    2.  **Implement the feature:** Modify the `plugin_manager.sh` to use an explicit plugin registry instead of file discovery.
    3.  **Refactor:** Clean up the plugin loading and validation logic.

## Task 4: Improve Documentation

*   **Status:** Not Started
*   **TDD Approach:** This task is not directly testable with automated tests. However, we can follow a similar iterative approach:
    1.  **Identify areas for improvement:** Review the scripts and identify areas where the documentation is lacking or unclear.
    2.  **Write the documentation:** Add detailed comments and descriptions to the identified areas.
    3.  **Review and refine:** Review the new documentation for clarity, consistency, and accuracy.

## Task 5: Enhance Security

*   **Status:** Not Started
*   **TDD Approach:**
    1.  **Write a failing test:** Create new test cases that attempt to exploit potential security vulnerabilities, such as command injection or insecure file permissions.
    2.  **Implement the feature:** Harden the scripts by adding more rigorous input validation, ensuring strict file permissions, and minimizing the use of `sudo`.
    3.  **Refactor:** Review the security enhancements for effectiveness and efficiency.
