# QX Active Tasks

This document tracks current active tasks for the QX project. All Phase 0 improvements have been completed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## ✅ Task 1: Enhanced Error Handling and Automatic Rollback - COMPLETED

*   **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Added ERR trap:** Modified `install_tools` function in `install-prereqs.sh` to trap the `ERR` signal.
    2.  **Automatic rollback:** Added automatic rollback call in the `ERR` trap handler.
    3.  **Trap cleanup:** Trap is removed after successful completion to prevent false rollbacks.
*   **Benefits:** Ensures system stability by automatically undoing changes on installation failures.

## ✅ Task 2: Improved Configuration Validation - COMPLETED

*   **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Enhanced validation:** Improved `validate_config()` function in `config.sh` with comprehensive tool configuration validation.
    2.  **Version validation:** Added validation for tool versions (semver format), install paths (absolute paths), and package names.
    3.  **Profile validation:** Implemented profile configuration validation against the plugin registry.
*   **Benefits:** Catches configuration errors early with specific, actionable error messages.

## ✅ Task 3: Refined Plugin Management - COMPLETED

*   **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Explicit registry:** Replaced file discovery with explicit `PLUGIN_REGISTRY` array in `plugin_manager.sh`.
    2.  **Registry contents:** Only loads plugins explicitly listed in registry: `bun`, `podman`, `kubectl`, `kind`.
    3.  **Backward compatibility:** Added backward compatibility alias for `detect_plugin_tool()`.
*   **Benefits:** Prevents accidental loading of non-plugin scripts, improves security and maintainability.

## ✅ Task 4: Enhanced Documentation - COMPLETED

*   **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Script headers:** Added detailed "Description" headers to main scripts explaining purpose and features.
    2.  **Inline documentation:** Enhanced inline documentation for complex modules:
        - `install-prereqs.sh`: Full feature overview and requirements
        - `downloader.sh`: Security features and function descriptions
        - `rollback.sh`: Detailed rollback capabilities explanation
    3.  **Consistency:** Used consistent commenting style throughout.
*   **Benefits:** Improved maintainability and developer experience.

## ✅ Task 5: Enhanced Security - COMPLETED

*   **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Input validation:** Added rigorous validation in `parse_arguments()` for:
        - Profile values (must be minimal/development/full)
        - Tool names (alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores only)
        - Channel values (stable/latest/beta/nightly)
        - Required arguments with proper error messages
    2.  **File permissions:** Verified temporary files created with 600 permissions.
    3.  **Privilege escalation:** Maintained minimal sudo usage with proper root checks.
*   **Benefits:** Prevents common attack vectors like shell injection and input manipulation.

## Testing and Validation

All improvements have been thoroughly tested in disposable Podman containers:

*   **Dry-run Mode:** ✅ Validated - no filesystem changes
*   **Input Validation:** ✅ Validated - proper error messages for invalid inputs
*   **Configuration Loading:** ✅ Validated - YAML config loads correctly
*   **Plugin System:** ✅ Validated - explicit registry prevents unauthorized loading
*   **Error Handling:** ✅ Validated - proper error messages and exit codes

## Implementation Summary

The QX scripts now provide a robust, secure, and maintainable installation system with:
- Automatic rollback on failures
- Comprehensive input validation
- Explicit plugin management
- Enhanced documentation
- Security hardening

All changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving reliability and security.

**Note:** This document was updated to reflect the actual completion status. The previous version incorrectly showed tasks as "Not Started" when they were actually implemented. See `docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` for detailed implementation notes.
