ls -la .gitignore .githooks/ .github/
ls -la *.md

# 4. Test git hooks (optional but recommended)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Merge Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts (unlikely for doc-only changes):

```

### CI/CD Issues After Merge

If GitHub Actions fails after merge:

```bash
# 1. Check workflow syntax
cat .github/workflows/tests.yml

# 2. Verify permissions
# Go to: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
# Ensure: "Read and write permissions" enabled

# 3. Check runner availability
# Go to: Actions tab ‚Üí Check workflow runs

# 4. Debug locally
act -l  # If 'act' is installed
```

### Git Hooks Not Working

```bash
# 1. Verify hook is installed
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit

# 2. Ensure it's executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
